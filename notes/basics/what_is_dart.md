# What is Dart?

Dart is an open-source programming language developed by Google.

- It is **object-oriented**, **strongly typed**, and optimized for building modern apps.
- Dart syntax is similar to Java, JavaScript, and C#, making it easier to adopt for developers from those backgrounds.

## 🚀 Dart Compilation Models

Dart uses two compilation approaches:

### 🔁 Just-in-Time (JIT)

- Used during development
- Enables **hot reload** for fast iteration
- Instant feedback for UI updates and logic tweaks

### 📦 Ahead-of-Time (AOT)

- Used in production
- Compiles Dart to **native machine code**
- Results in faster startup time and better performance

## 🧠 Why Dart?

- Great support for **Flutter** — a cross-platform framework
- Strong tooling (DevTools, VS Code/Android Studio integration)
- Null safety by default
- Easy to learn, powerful to scale
